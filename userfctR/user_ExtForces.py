    Parameters
    ----------
    PxF : numpy.ndarray
        Position vector (index starting at 1) of the force sensor expressed in
        the inertial frame: PxF[1:4] = [P_x, P_y, P_z]
    RxF : numpy.ndarray
        Rotation matrix (index starting at 1) from the inertial frame to the
        force sensor frame: Frame_sensor = RxF[1:4,1:4] * Frame_inertial
    VxF : numpy.ndarray
        Velocity vector (index starting at 1) of the force sensor expressed in
        the inertial frame: VxF[1:4] = [V_x, V_y, V_z]
    OMxF : numpy.ndarray
        Angular velocity vector (index starting at 1) of the force sensor
        expressed in the inertial frame: OMxF[1:4] = [OM_x, OM_y, OM_z]
    AxF : numpy.ndarray
        Acceleration vector (index starting at 1) of the force sensor expressed
        in the inertial frame: AxF[1:4] = [A_x, A_y, A_z]
    OMPxF : numpy.ndarray
        Angular acceleration vector (index starting at 1) of the force sensor
        expressed in the inertial frame: OMPxF[1:4] = [OMP_x, OMP_y, OMP_z]
    mbs_data : MBsysPy.MbsData
        The multibody system associated to this computation.
    tsim : float
        The current time of the simulation.
    ixF : int
        The ID identifying the computed force sensor.

    Notes
    -----
    For 1D numpy.ndarray with index starting at 1, the first index (array[0])
    must not be modified. The first index to be filled is array[1].

    For 2D numpy.ndarray with index starting at 1, the first row (mat[0, :]) and
    line (mat[:,0]) must not be modified. The subarray to be filled is mat[1:, 1:].

    Returns
    -------
    Swr : numpy.ndarray
        An array of length 10 equal to [0., Fx, Fy, Fz, Mx, My, Mz, dxF].
        F_# are the forces components expressed in inertial frame.
        M_# are the torques components expressed in inertial frame.
        dxF is an array of length 3 containing the component of the forces/torque
        application point expressed in the BODY-FIXED frame.
        This array is a specific line of MbsData.SWr.
